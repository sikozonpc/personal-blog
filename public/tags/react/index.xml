      <description>&amp;ldquo;At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.&amp;rdquo; -Webpack
 That quote is the original description that&amp;rsquo;s on the webpack official website.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t understood it well and you don&amp;rsquo;t even know what a module bundler is don&amp;rsquo;t worry, by the end of this article I will do my best to try to explain everything.</description>

      <description>NOTE: This article was origanily posted on Medium.
 So I’ve been learning React for a few months and I wanted to share some of the knowledge I acquired during this journey.
Building software with React is quite a pleasure for me, I learned new and better ways to do it everyday. However, at the start, especially if you are new to software development it can be a bit overwhelming and complex to understand the abstractions made by these frameworks.</description>
