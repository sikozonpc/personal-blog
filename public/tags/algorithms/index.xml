      <description>In my humble opinion I think problem solving is the single most desired skill in a developer or an engineer and odds are if you came from a self-taught path like me, algorithms and complex data structures might be daunting.
At the start I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even solve easy problems on Hackerrank, even though I knew how to make well rounded applications, and that made me frustrated and anxious.
So, at the time, I decided to learn the basics of computer science and also took a course on algorithms and data structures with JavaScript from Colt Steele which I highly recommend taking if you relate to me.</description>

      <description>Along side with my other post about Problem Solving Techniques, in this one I will explain in more detail a pattern to solve algorithms, this is the first part from a collection of posts about algorithm patterns
What I&amp;rsquo;m about to talk here is mostly based on the Colt Steele course on JavaScript algorithms which I highly recommend.
Frequency Counters If you&amp;rsquo;re working on strings or arrays problems this one is a good candidate for that kind of problems.</description>
